## Assignment 1 for 615
Consider the following situation:
A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to know how many pages
have more than k misprints in a book of n pages. Make an n x k table that shows the relationship between
the total number of pages in a book and the number of pages with k misprints.
Show and explain your work. Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem.
Include an image of a book.
Push your solution to a github repository and submit the url for repository on blackboard. Be sure your repo includes your document as a pdf file and as an RMD file. Include other files needed to recompile your document.

# Solution
Separate this probolem into two steps:
The first step is to caculate the number of pages with k misprints by using poisson distribution.
The second step is to caculate a book of m pages which contains k misprints by using binomial distribution.
The equations of the above distribution:
Under this situation, we need Poisson Ditribution,noted $\lambda=2$ and the equation is:
$ P(X=k)=\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda} $
$\binom{50}{n} p^{n}q^{50-n}$
The result will be displayed in a form of table.


# step 1 Calcualte the Poission distribution
$ P(X>k)$

```{r}
k <-0:10
probk <- ppois(k,lambda = 2,lower.tail=FALSE)
prob <- matrix(probk,nrow=1,ncol=11)
prob

```
# step2 Calculate 
$ P(m<=n|misprints>k)$

```{r}
m<- matrix(1:50,nrow=50)
probr <- matrix(rep(0,length(k)*length(m)),nrow=length(m),ncol=length(k))
for(j in 1:length(k)){
  for(i in 1:length(m)){
    probr[i,j]=pbinom(m[i,],size=50,prob[,j])
  }
}

table=as.data.frame(matrix(probr,nrow=length(m),ncol=length(k),dimnames=list(c(1:50),c("k=0","k=1","k=2","k=3","k=4","k=5","k=6","k=7","k=8","k=9","k=10"))))
